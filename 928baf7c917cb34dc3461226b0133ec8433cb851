      "message": "This is to allow flexibility when adding allowed subnbets for extPol. Usually they would be associated with single EPG. But by doing a longest prefix match we can have overlapping subnets. So say a default subnet 0.0.0.0/0 using EPG-A and a more specific 100.100.100.0/24 using EPG-B",

      "message": "because tunDst will not have overlap. existing remote eps are 32 bit. for CSR may be we can\nhave multiple EPGs but as of now they are not ready so I am not sure what support is needed besides the fact that we know the CSR gw IP and MAC.\nYes no output port for non-tunnel. Its goes over veth_host. see the flow I removed that was allow all, this basically provides a mechanism to do the same based on subnets. Mandeep wanted me to use remote EP model rather than add something new to the model.",
