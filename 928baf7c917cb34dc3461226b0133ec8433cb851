      "message": "This is to allow flexibility when adding allowed subnbets for extPol. Usually they would be associated with single EPG. But by doing a longest prefix match we can have overlapping subnets. So say a default subnet 0.0.0.0/0 using EPG-A and a more specific 100.100.100.0/24 using EPG-B",
