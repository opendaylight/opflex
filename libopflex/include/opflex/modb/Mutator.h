/**
 * @brief A mutator represents a set of changes to apply to the data
 * store.
 *
 * When modifying data through the managed object accessor classes,
 * changes are not actually written into the store, but rather are
 * written into the Mutator registered using the framework in a
 * thread-local variable.  These changes will not become visible until
 * the mutator is committed by calling commit()
 *
 * The changes are applied to the data store all at once but not
 * necessarily guaranteed to be atomic.  That is, a read in another
 * thread could see some objects updated but not others. Each
 * individual object update <i>is</i> applied atomically, however, so
 * the fields within that object will either all be modified or none.
 *
 * This is most similar to a database transaction with an isolation
 * level set to read uncommitted.
