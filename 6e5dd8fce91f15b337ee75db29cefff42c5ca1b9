      "message": "I\u0027m a little confused about the purpose of this class. Seems like enforcer::Inventory is doing the same thing (tracking relationships between objects) through the BackLinkMap objects. It doesn\u0027t use the gbpmodel classes yet, so perhaps we should just integrate that class with gbp (on my todo list)",

      "message": "This is computing the indexes I need for the endpoint manager functionality, but they\u0027re not just simple relationships, as will be more clear when I finish with the next chunk of code.  I\u0027m really just implementing the exact design I did with ODL which I know works.  If we need/want to refactor later we can, but I\u0027d like to make progress now",
