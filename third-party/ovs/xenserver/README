This directory contains files for seamless integration of Open vSwitch on
Citrix XenServer hosts managed by the Citrix management tools.

Files in this directory are licensed on a file-by-file basis.  Please
refer to each file for details.

Most of the files in this directory are installed on a XenServer system
under the same name; underscores are replaced by slashes.  The files are:

    etc_init.d_openvswitch-xapi-update

        Init script to ensure openvswitch-cfg-update is called for the
        current host at boot.

    etc_logrotate.d_openvswitch

        Ensures that logs in /var/log/openvswitch are rotated
        periodically and that appropriate daemons reopen their log
        files at that point.

Open vSwitch installs a number of xen-bugtool extensions in
/etc/xensource/bugtool to gather additional information useful for
debugging.  The sources for the extensions are in
../utilities/bugtool/plugins:

    kernel-info/openvswitch.xml

        Collect kernel information relevant to Open vSwitch, such as
        slabinfo.

    network-status/openvswitch.xml

        Collect networking information relevant to Open vSwitch.  Runs
        the following scripts, which are described below:

            * ovs-bugtool-bfd-show
            * ovs-bugtool-cfm-show
            * ovs-bugtool-lacp-show
            * ovs-bugtool-list-dbs
            * ovs-bugtool-ovsdb-dump
            * ovs-bugtool-tc-class-show
            * ovs-bugtool-bond-show
            * ovs-bugtool-ovs-ofctl-show

            * ovs-bugtool-ovs-appctl-dpif
            * ovs-bugtool-coverage-show
            * ovs-bugtool-memory-show
            * ovs-bugtool-vsctl-show

    system-configuration/openvswitch.xml

        Collect system configuration information relevant to Open vSwitch,
        including timezone. Runs the following script which is described
        below:

            * ovs-bugtool-daemons-ver

    system-configuration.xml

        Collect system configuration data.  This category is configured
        to collect up to 1Mb of data, take up to 60 seconds to collect
        data, run every time and is hidden from display in XenCenter.
