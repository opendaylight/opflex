/* Concurrent hash map
 * ===================
 *
 * A single-writer, multiple-reader hash table that efficiently supports
 * duplicates.
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * The general rules are:
 *
 *    - Only a single thread may safely call into cmap_insert(),
 *      cmap_remove(), or cmap_replace() at any given time.
 *
 *    - Any number of threads may use functions and macros that search or
 *      iterate through a given cmap, even in parallel with other threads
 *      calling cmap_insert(), cmap_remove(), or cmap_replace().
 *
 *      There is one exception: cmap_find_protected() is only safe if no thread
 *      is currently calling cmap_insert(), cmap_remove(), or cmap_replace().
 *      (Use ordinary cmap_find() if that is not guaranteed.)
 *
 *    - See "Iteration" below for additional thread safety rules.
 *
 * Writers must use special care to ensure that any elements that they remove
 * do not get freed or reused until readers have finished with them.  This
 * includes inserting the element back into its original cmap or a different
 * one.  One correct way to do this is to free them from an RCU callback with
 * ovsrcu_postpone().

 * CMAP and HASH are evaluated only once.  NODE is evaluated many times.
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * CMAP_FOR_EACH_WITH_HASH will reliably visit each of the nodes with the
 * specified hash in CMAP, even with concurrent insertions and deletions.  (Of
 * course, if nodes with the given HASH are being inserted or deleted, it might
 * or might not visit the nodes actually being inserted or deleted.)
 *
 * CMAP_FOR_EACH_WITH_HASH_PROTECTED may only be used if CMAP is guaranteed not
 * to change during iteration.  It may be very slightly faster.

/* Iteration.
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Iteration is safe even in a cmap that is changing concurrently.  However:
 *
 *     - In the presence of concurrent calls to cmap_insert(), any given
 *       iteration might skip some nodes and might visit some nodes more than
 *       once.  If this is a problem, then the iterating code should lock the
 *       data structure (a rwlock can be used to allow multiple threads to
 *       iterate in parallel).
 *
 *     - Concurrent calls to cmap_remove() don't have the same problem.  (A
 *       node being deleted may be visited once or not at all.  Other nodes
 *       will be visited once.)
 *
 *
 * Example
 * =======
 *
 *     struct my_node {
 *         struct cmap_node cmap_node;
 *         int extra_data;
 *     };
 *
 *     struct cmap_cursor cursor;
 *     struct my_node *iter;
 *     struct cmap my_map;
 *
 *     cmap_init(&cmap);
 *     ...add data...
 *     CMAP_FOR_EACH (my_node, cmap_node, &cursor, &cmap) {
 *         ...operate on my_node...
 *     }
 *
 * CMAP_FOR_EACH_SAFE variant is useful only in deallocation code already
 * executing at postponed time, when it is known that the RCU grace period
 * has already expired.
