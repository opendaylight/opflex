.SS "COVERAGE COMMANDS"
These commands manage \fB\*(PN\fR's ``coverage counters,'' which count
the number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
In addition to these commands, \fB\*(PN\fR automatically logs coverage
counter values, at \fBINFO\fR level, when it detects that the daemon's
main loop takes unusually long to run.
.PP
Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and
debugging.
.IP "\fBcoverage/show\fR"
Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds, the
last minute and the last hour, and the total counts of all of the
coverage counters.
