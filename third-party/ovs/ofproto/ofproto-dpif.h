/* Ofproto-dpif -- DPIF based ofproto implementation.
 *
 * Ofproto-dpif provides an ofproto implementation for those platforms which
 * implement the netdev and dpif interface defined in netdev.h and dpif.h.  The
 * most important of which is the Linux Kernel Module (dpif-linux), but
 * alternatives are supported such as a userspace only implementation
 * (dpif-netdev), and a dummy implementation used for unit testing.
 *
 * Ofproto-dpif is divided into three major chunks.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif.c
 *   The main ofproto-dpif module is responsible for implementing the
 *   provider interface, installing and removing datapath flows, maintaining
 *   packet statistics, running protocols (BFD, LACP, STP, etc), and
 *   configuring relevant submodules.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif-upcall.c
 *   Ofproto-dpif-upcall is responsible for retrieving upcalls from the kernel,
 *   processing miss upcalls, and handing more complex ones up to the main
 *   ofproto-dpif module.  Miss upcall processing boils down to figuring out
 *   what each packet's actions are, executing them (i.e. asking the kernel to
 *   forward it), and handing it up to ofproto-dpif to decided whether or not
 *   to install a kernel flow.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif-xlate.c
 *   Ofproto-dpif-xlate is responsible for translating OpenFlow actions into
 *   datapath actions. */

/*
 * Recirculation
 * =============
 *
 * Recirculation is a technique to allow a frame to re-enter the packet
 * processing path for one or multiple times to achieve more flexible packet
 * processing in the data path. MPLS handling and selecting bond slave port
 * of a bond ports.
 *
 * Data path and user space interface
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * Two new fields, recirc_id and dp_hash, are added to the current flow data
 * structure. They are both of type uint32_t. In addition, a new action,
 * RECIRC, are added.
 *
 * The value recirc_id is used to distinguish a packet from multiple
 * iterations of recirculation. A packet initially received is considered of
 * having recirc_id of 0. Recirc_id is managed by the user space, opaque to
 * the data path.
 *
 * On the other hand, dp_hash can only be computed by the data path, opaque to
 * the user space. In fact, user space may not able to recompute the hash
 * value. The dp_hash value should be wildcarded when for a newly received
 * packet. RECIRC action specifies whether the hash is computed. If computed,
 * how many fields to be included in the hash computation. The computed hash
 * value is stored into the dp_hash field prior to recirculation.
 *
 * The RECIRC action computes and set the dp_hash field, set the recirc_id
 * field and then reprocess the packet as if it was received on the same input
 * port. RECIRC action works like a function call; actions listed behind the
 * RECIRC action will be executed after its execution.  RECIRC action can be
 * nested, data path implementation limits the number of recirculation executed
 * to prevent unreasonable nesting depth or infinite loop.
 *
 * Both flow fields and the RECIRC action are exposed as open flow fields via
 * Nicira extensions.
 *
 * Post recirculation flow
 * ------------------------
 *
 * At the open flow level, post recirculation rules are always hidden from the
 * controller.  They are installed in table 254 which is set up as a hidden
 * table during boot time. Those rules are managed by the local user space
 * program only.
 *
 * To speed up the classifier look up process, recirc_id is always reflected
 * into the metadata field, since recirc_id is required to be exactly matched.
 *
 * Classifier look up always starts with table 254. A post recirculation flow
 * lookup should find its hidden rule within this table. On the other hand, A
 * newly received packet should miss all post recirculation rules because its
 * recirc_id is zero, then hit a pre-installed lower priority rule to redirect
 * classifier to look up starting from table 0:
 *
 *       * , actions=resubmit(,0)
 *
 * Post recirculation data path flows are managed like other data path flows.
 * They are created on demand. Miss handling, stats collection and revalidation
 * work the same way as regular flows.
