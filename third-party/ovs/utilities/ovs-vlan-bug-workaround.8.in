.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.PP
Some Linux network drivers support a feature called ``VLAN
acceleration''.  VLAN acceleration is associated with a data structure
called a \fBvlan_group\fR that is, abstractly, a dictionary that maps
from a VLAN ID (in the range 0 to 4095) to a VLAN device, that is, a
Linux network device associated with a particular VLAN,
e.g. \fBeth0.9\fR for VLAN 9 on \fBeth0\fR.
.PP
Some drivers that support VLAN acceleration have bugs that fall
roughly into the categories listed below.  \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR(8)
can test for these driver bugs.
.so utilities/ovs-vlan-bugs.man
.PP
.PP
The correct long term solution is to fix these driver bugs.
.PP
For now, \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround\fR can enable a special-purpose
workaround for devices with buggy VLAN acceleration.  A kernel patch
must be applied for this workaround to work.
.PP
Use the command \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround \fInetdev\fR \fBon\fR to
enable the VLAN driver bug workaround for network device \fInetdev\fR.
Use the command \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround \fInetdev\fR \fBoff\fR to
disable the VLAN driver bug workaround for network device \fInetdev\fR.
.SH "DRIVER DETAILS"
.PP
The following drivers in Linux version
2.6.32.12-0.7.1.xs1.0.0.311.170586 implement VLAN acceleration and are
relevant to Open vSwitch on XenServer.  We have not tested any version
of most of these drivers, so we do not know whether they have a VLAN
problem that needs to be fixed.  The drivers are listed by the name
that they report in, e.g., \fBethtool \-i\fR output; in a few cases
this differs slightly from the name of the module's \fB.ko\fR file:

The following drivers use \fBvlan_group\fR but are irrelevant to Open
vSwitch on XenServer:
.IP "\fBbonding\fR"
Not used with Open vSwitch on XenServer.
.IP "\fBgianfar\fR"
Not shipped with XenServer.  A FreeScale CPU-integrated device.
.IP "\fBehea\fR"
Cannot be built on x86.  IBM Power architecture only.
.IP "\fBstmmac\fR"
Cannot be built on x86.  SH4 architecture only.
.IP "\fBvmxnet3\fR"
Not shipped with XenServer.  For use inside VMware VMs only.
