      "message": "Yes, I\u0027ll get Jenkins to build OVS very soon.\n\nRegarding testing: For something as basic as the connection stuff, I don\u0027t think we really want to test against an ad-hoc, mock switch. Doing the mock properly will be a fair amount of work, and I\u0027m not sure it is worth. On the other hand, given that all this stuff requires OVS anyway, it is not unreasonable to expect the system that it will run on to have OVS. We can make the test self-contained though so that it takes care of setting up whatever it needs.",
